# Vocal-Odyssey

**Vocal Odyssey** is an AI-powered mobile application designed to help young children improve their **pronunciation and speech skills** through structured, engaging, and interactive learning. Developed as our final year project, it combines gamified learning with real-time speech evaluation to provide a hands-on pronunciation training experience unlike traditional passive learning platforms.

## ðŸ§  What We Built

We built **Vocal Odyssey**, a mobile app that helps children improve their pronunciation through interactive, level-based learning. Unlike typical passive learning apps, ours focuses on **active speaking practice** with real-time feedback.

### ðŸ“± How It Works

- Kids progress through levels: **phonics â†’ words â†’ sentences**
- Each word is played using **text-to-speech**
- Kids repeat it â€” their speech is scored using **AI**
- They earn **stars and rewards** for correct pronunciation
- **Parents/teachers** can track progress with graphs and reports
- **Admins** can manage users and levels across modules
